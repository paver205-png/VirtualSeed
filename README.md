Emergence of Self / Non-Self through energy-based survival (no reward, no goals)
# VirtualSeed

**VirtualSeed** is an experimental minimal system designed to test a fundamental hypothesis:

> Can a self-organizing, self-distinguishing intelligence emerge without a predefined Self, goals, rewards, or growth — purely through energy-based survival and experience?

## Core principles
- No reward functions, scores, or goals
- No predefined Self or world model
- Fixed architecture after birth
- Energy (E) as the only survival signal
- Strict experimental honesty and reproducibility

## Key result
A stable **Self / Non-Self boundary** emerged spontaneously as a statistical distinction based on the predictability of energy change (ΔE) caused by the system’s own actions.

This boundary was **not programmed**, but formed through experience alone.

## Status
The hypothesis has been verified under constrained environmental conditions.
